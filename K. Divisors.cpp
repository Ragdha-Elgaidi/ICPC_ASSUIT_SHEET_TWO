/*

Divisor of Number is A number that divides the integer exactly (no remainder).

In other words the division works perfectly with no fractions or remainders involved.

Examples:

	3 is a divisor of 12, because 12 รท 3 = 4 exactly
	4 is a divisor of 12, because 12 รท 4 = 3 exactly.
	5 is not a divisor of 12, because 12 รท 5 = 2 with a remainder of 2.

a divisor is also a factor of the original integer.*/
